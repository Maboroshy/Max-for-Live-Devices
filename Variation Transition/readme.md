![Preview](https://github.com/Maboroshy/Max-for-Live-Devices/blob/main/Variation%20Transition/Variation%20Transition.gif?raw=true)

This device is inspired by Smooth Automator by KBDevices.

The device attaches to a rack and acts as a variation selector. It makes a smooth transition to the selected variation from the rack’s current state. It features:

- Numbox and dial variation selectors for mapping
- Manual or automatic transition launch
- Launch quantization and duration settings
- Mappable slider for transition progress (disable "Auto" launch and "Duration" for slider only control)
- Buttons to select the first 8 variations and to move to the next or previous variation, with an option to work only on armed track for shared mappings
- Сustom duration settings for each of the first 8 variations
